Booleans are the foundation of decision-making in code.\n\nPython has six **comparison operators** that evaluate to Boolean values:\n\n| Operator | Meaning | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` → `True` |\n| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` → `True` |\n| `<` | Less than | `3 < 5` → `True` |\n| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3` → `True` |\n| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `5 <= 5` → `True` |\n| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 6` → `False` |\n\n**Critical distinction:** `=` is the assignment operator (stores a value), while `==` is the comparison operator (checks equality).\n\n**Type matters:** `42 == 42.0` is `True` (same numeric value), but `42 == '42'` is `False` (int vs string)."
